## <a name="data-type">What is a data type? Intro (5 mins)</a>

From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type):


_In computer science and computer programming, a data type or simply 'type' is a classification identifying one of various types of data that determines the possible values for that type, the operations that can be done on values of that type, the meaning of the data, and the way values of that type can be stored._  

Data types are really similar across different languages:

What this means is that being confident in working with these concepts critically will enable you to walk into any programming language with some base knowledge that is translateable.

| Data Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strings | Single words or sentences or characters, surrounded by double or single quotes. In JavaScript we will always use single quotes. | `'lots of kittens'`, `'lots of kittens'` |
| Integers | Whole numbers. | `42`, `1024` |
| Floats | Decimals. | `3.14`, `3.0` |
| Booleans | Represents either true or false | `true`, `false` |

We'll elaborate on all of these - except Booleans, for now. We'll talk about how they behave in JavaScript, show you some helper methods to work with each type, and then practice these helper methods to manipulate data using JavaScript.


#### What are we working with? Code along (20mins)

We have two ways to run Javascript, and we're going to introduce two more ways to do it in Chrome next week.

In your terminal run $`brew install node`

For this lesson, we're going to use the Node REPL in the terminal. You can do this in Cloud9 or in your Terminal if you have Node installed.

**Cloud9**: Open your WDI_Remote workspace and open a Terminal window and run the binary `node`

**Terminal**: Open your Terminal and run the binary `node`

**First Way**
This can be done in your terminal or in the bash window in Cloud9

1. $`brew install node`
2. Once you have node installed you can run $`node` and it will open up a JavaScript REPL
3. ^C (control + C) twice to exit.

**Second Way**

1. Touch a file ending with `.js` like `test.js`
2. Open that file and add the line `console.log('hello world!')`
3. Save that file.
4. cd into the directory that holds that file and then run `node test.js`

Node is running the file test.js and the function console.log() will log whatever value is passed in to the console (the terminal)

(Project non-specific binaries can be run from any directory!)

#### typeof()

To get an idea of the type of data we're working with, we can use [`typeof()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof).  Let's try it out in the console with the following:

```js
typeof 37
=> 'number'

typeof 37 === 'number';
=> true

typeof 'hi there'
=> string

typeof 'hi there' === 'string';
=> true

```

`typeof()` returns a string with the type of the operand, or expression of the object you're looking at.  


#### Numbers

In more low-level languages, numbers are divided into two datatypes objects:

* Integers

```js
   ..., -1,0, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
```

* Floats (or Decimal numbers)

```js
2.718, 3.14, .5, .25, etc
```

Exercise: Ask node for the typeof() a whole number and then a decimal


#### Arithmetic Operators

Operators are used to work with data in JavaScript. The standard [arithmetic operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#Arithmetic_operators) - that you've been learning since grade school - are supported, including addition, subtraction, modulus (or remainder) multiplication and so forth.  Check it out:

```js
1 + 2
=> 3

2 - 5
=> -3

5 / 2
=> 2.5

6 * 2
=> 12
```

Exercise: Take five minutes to play with your arithmetic operands in the Node repl. Try the operators we just covered but don't limit yourself to just single digits. See if you can break it or get unexpected behavior.

#### Special Number Operators

We've seen that JavaScript allows us to perform simple arithmetic functions but what about more complex functions like square roots or exponents?

Exercise: Take 5 minutes to look at the [Math documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) and pick a function to quickly explain to the class. We'll popcorn around the room each person will get 30 seconds to explain what their function is/does. Don't worry if you chose the same one as someone else. Repetition leads to retention!


* Taking a number to some `power`? Then just use `Math.pow`

```js
// 3^2 becomes
Math.pow(3,2)
=> 9

// 2^4 becomes
Math.pow(2,4)
=> 16
```

* Taking a square root

```js
// âˆš(4) becomes
Math.sqrt(4)
=> 2
```

* Need a `random` number? Then use `Math.random`.

```js
// The following only returns a random decimal
Math.random()
=> .229375290430
/*
The following will return a
random number between 0 and 10
*/
Math.random()*10
```

* Since Numbers can be **Floats** or **Integers** we often want to get rid of remaining decimal places, which can be done using `Math.floor`.

```js
// Remove the decimal
Math.floor(3.14)
=> 3
Math.floor(3.9999)
=> 3
```

#### Strings

Strings are collections of letters and symbols known as *characters*, and we use them to deal with words and text in JavaScript. Strings are just another type of **value** in Javascript.

```js
'John'
'Jane'
'123'
```

SIDENOTE: double quotes vs single quotes?

#### String helper methods

To find the length of a string, access its [`length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length) property:

```js
'hello'.length;
=> 5
```

Strings have other [methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Methods) as well that allow you to manipulate the string and access information about the string:

```js
'hello'.charAt(0);
=> 'h'

'hello, world'.replace('hello', 'goodbye');
=> 'goodbye, world'

'hello'.toUpperCase();
=> 'HELLO'
```

# <a name="string-concat">String Concatentation and Coercion</a>

What if we want to turn two or more strings into one string?

It's the same as if we'd like to turn two or more numbers into one number i.e.:

- 5 + 5 results in 10
- 'hello' and 'world' resulting in 'hello world'

JavaScript allows us to add our strings together so:

```javascript
'hello' + 'world'
=> 'helloworld'
```

What's wrong with this result?

Well, because strings store text we need to be able to account for spaces. This results in a sort of inelegant solution where we have to remember to add a space in one string.

```javascript
'hello' + ' world' // note the space!
=> 'hello world'
```

The newest version of ES6 gives us a more elegant pattern called string interpolation using a new datatype called `string templates`

Rather than single quotes we use back ticks \`\`

```javascript
var firstWord = 'hello'
var secondWord = 'world'

`${firstWord} ${secondWord}`
=> 'hello world'
```

EXERCISE: Take 5 minutes to concatenate strings using both the `+` method and using string templates \`\` and string interpolation `${}`


What happens if we add a string to a number? Take 15 seconds and try it in Node.

```javascript
var a = 42;

var b = a + '';         // implicit coercion

var c = String( a );    // explicit coercion
```

#### Converting Strings to Integers with parseInt() and parseFloat()

You can convert a string to an integer using the built-in [`parseInt()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt) function. This takes the base for the conversion as an optional second argument, which you should always provide:

```javascript
parseInt('123');
=> 123

parseInt('010', 10);
=> 10
```

This will be important later when we're taking user input from the web or from the command line and using it on our server or in our browser to do some type of numeric calculation.

Similarly, you can parse floating point numbers using the built-in [`parseFloat()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat) function which uses base 10 always unlike its `parseInt()` cousin.

```javascript
parseFloat('11.2');
=> 11.2
```

You can also use the unary `+` operator to convert values to numbers:

```javascript
+'42';
=> 42
```

EXERCISE: Let's take five minutes to use parseInt() and parseFloat() in node

#### NaN

The `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()` functions parse a string until they reach a character that isn't valid for the specified number format, then return the number parsed up to that point. However the '+' operator simply converts the string to `NaN` if there is any invalid character in it.

A special value called [`NaN`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN) (short for 'Not a Number') is returned if the string is non-numeric:

Username example:

```javascript
parseInt('colin1990');
=> NaN

parseInt('1990colin');
=> 1990
```

You can test for `NaN` using the built-in [`isNaN()`](ttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN) function:

```javascript
isNaN(NaN);
=> true
```
JavaScript's numeric operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%` and all work as you expect and should have practiced during your pre-work.

#### Null and Undefined

JavaScript distinguishes between:

- `null` a value that indicates a deliberate non-value
- `undefined` that indicates an uninitialized value â€” that is, a value hasn't even been assigned yet

## <a name="var-and-keywords">Variables and Keywords - Codealong (10 mins)</a>

Variables are used to store data types into the memory of the computer so that they can be referenced later.

#### Always use var!

New variables in JavaScript are declared using the [`var`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var '/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var') keyword.

If you declare a variable without assigning any value to it, its type is `undefined`.

```javascript
var a;
=> undefined
```

So lets try assigning a value to variable:

```javascript
var name = 'Thom';
=> undefined

name
=> 'Thom'
```

Having made some expressions it becomes evident we want to store these values.

```javascript
var myNumber = 1;
// or also

var myString = 'Greetings y\'all!'
```

SIDENOTES: camelCase and \' ... But why?

The main note to make here is that these variables should always have the `var` keyword and use `camelCase`

#### Assignment Operators

Values are assigned using `=`, and there are also compound assignment statements such as `+=` and `-=`:

```javascript
var x = 1;
=> 1

x += 5
=> 6
```

You can use `++` and `--` to increment and decrement, respectively. These can be used as prefix or postfix operators.

In Javascript we just discussed two types of values we can use. We call these values objects, which for now just means that in addition to storing some data you also get to use some helpful methods when you are working with them.

* If you want to turn a number into a string you can use a helpful method called `toString`.

```javascript
(1).toString()
=> '1'
/**
be careful though,
since numbers can be floats
javascript might
misunderstand you.
*/
1.toString()
=> Float Error
// but the following works
1..toString()
```


## <a name="arrays">Arrays - Demo (5 mins)</a>

Unfortunately, strings and numbers are not enough for most programming purposes.
What is needed are collections of data that we can use efficiently, Arrays.

Arrays are great for:

* Storing data
* Enumerating data, i.e. using an index to find them
* Quickly reordering data

Arrays, ultimately, are a data structure that is similar in concept to a comma separated list. Each item in an array is called an element, and the collection can contain data of the same or different types. In JavaScript, they can dynamically grow and shrink in size.


```javascript
var friends = ['Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly'];
=> ['Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly']
```

Items in an array are stored in sequential order, and indexed starting at `0` and ending at `length - 1`.

```javascript
// First friend
var firstFriend = friends[0];
=> 'Moe'
// Get the last friend
var lastFriend = friends[2]
=> 'Curly'
```

We can even use strings like arrays: (literally array-like)

```javascript
var friend = 'bobby bottleservice';
// pick out first character
friend[0]
//=> 'b'
friend.length
```


## <a name="working-with-arrays">Working with Arrays - Codealong (15 mins)</a>

Using the JavaScript Keyword `new`, is one way of creating arrays:

```javascript
var a = new Array();
=> undefined

a[0] = 'dog';
=> 'dog'

a[1] = 'cat';
=> 'cat'

a[2] = 'hen';
=> 'hen'

a
=> ['dog', 'cat', 'hen']

a.length;
=> 3
```

A more convenient notation is to use an array literal:

```javascript
var a = ['dog', 'cat', 'hen'];

a.length;
=> 3
```

#### Length method

The `length` method works in an interesting way in Javascript. It is always one more than the highest index in the array.

So `array.length` isn't necessarily the number of items in the array. Consider the following:

```javascript
var a = ['dog', 'cat', 'hen'];
a[100] = 'fox';
a.length; // 101
```
**Remember**: the length of the array is one more than the highest index.


EXERCISE: Make an array of your own with 6 items and save it to a variable `myArray`


#### Getting data from an array

If you query a non-existent array index, you get `undefined`:

```javascript
var a = ['dog', 'cat', 'hen'];
=> undefined

typeof a[90];
=> undefined
```

<br>

EXERCISE: 10 minutes 

- Ask for the 90th value in your array. 
- Ask for the first item in your array. 
- Ask for the last item in your array. 
- Bonus: Can you come up with a way of asking for a random index (whole number) between zero and the length of your array? HINT: Math.random and Math.floor


#### Array helper methods

Arrays come with a number of methods. Here's a list of some popular helpers:

> Note: You might want to demonstrate a few of these.

- `a.toString()` - Returns a string with the `toString()` of each element separated by commas.

- `a.pop()` - Removes and returns the last item.

- `a.push(item1, ..., itemN)` - `Push` adds one or more items to the end.

- `a.reverse()` - Reverse the array.

- `a.shift()` - Removes and returns the first item.

- `a.unshift([item])` - Prepends items to the start of the array.

Remember, though, you'll never remember _every_ method.  Explore the the [full documentation for array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) and other helper methods given to you for particular objects.

## <a name="conclusion">Conclusion (5 mins)</a>
